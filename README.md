# Pagerduty
 
Pagerduty Technical exam completed by Miles Toolin.

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this exercise utilizing Pagerduty. I extremely enjoyed playing with the platform and getting under the hood to understand the full extent of the capabilities. I look forward to being able to perform a platform Demonstration.

All answers and references for the exam are located under answers.md. I under screen shots were not required for the UI based steps but for the continuity of the documentation I believe it flows much nicer using the GitHub repository.

All Scripts located in Scripts folder and cURL commands were all executed utilizing Postman and the Pagerduty API.
